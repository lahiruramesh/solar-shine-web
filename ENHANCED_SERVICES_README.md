# Enhanced Services Management

The Solar Shine admin panel now includes an enhanced service management system that allows you to create services with the same level of detail as the hardcoded services on the Services page.

## New Service Fields

### Basic Information
- **Title** (required): Service name
- **Description**: Detailed service description
- **Icon**: Emoji or icon identifier
- **Link URL**: Optional link to service page
- **Display Order**: Position in the services list
- **Service Type**: Choose between "Main Service" or "Additional Service"

### Enhanced Content
- **Image**: Service-specific image for visual appeal
- **Benefits**: Array of key benefits (e.g., "Reduce electricity bills", "Increase home value")
- **Features**: Array of formatted feature strings (e.g., "Feature Name: Feature Description")

## Service Types

### Main Services
These are the primary service offerings that appear prominently on the Services page:
- Residential Solar
- Commercial Solar  
- Industrial Solar

### Additional Services
These are supplementary services that support the main offerings:
- Solar System Design
- Battery Storage Solutions
- Maintenance & Repairs

## How to Create Enhanced Services

### 1. Access the Admin Panel
- Navigate to `/admin`
- Go to the "Services" section

### 2. Add New Service
- Click "Add Service"
- Fill in the basic information
- Upload a service image
- Add benefits (one per line)
- Add features (name + description pairs)
- Choose service type
- Set display order

### 3. Example Service Structure

**Note**: Features are stored as formatted strings in the format "Feature Name: Feature Description" to maintain compatibility with Appwrite's database schema.

```json
{
  "title": "Residential Solar",
  "description": "Custom solar solutions for homes that reduce electricity bills and environmental impact.",
  "icon": "üè†",
  "service_type": "main",
  "benefits": [
    "Reduce or eliminate electricity bills",
    "Increase home value",
    "Energy independence"
  ],
  "features": [
    "Rooftop Solar Panels: High-efficiency panels designed to maximize energy production."
  ]
}
```

## Benefits of Enhanced Services

### For Content Managers
- **Rich Content**: Add detailed benefits and features

- **Better Organization**: Distinguish between main and additional services
- **Flexible Structure**: Easy to update and maintain

### For Website Visitors

## Database Schema Updates

The `service_cards` collection has been updated with new fields:

```json
{
  "image": "string (optional)",
  "benefits": "string[] (optional)",
  "features": "string[] (optional)",
  "service_type": "string (optional, default: 'additional')"
}
```

## Sample Data

Use the `sample_data/enhanced_service_cards.json` file as a reference for creating services that match the hardcoded structure from the Services page.

## Tips for Creating Great Services

1. **Use Clear Titles**: Make service names descriptive and easy to understand

3. **List Specific Benefits**: Focus on concrete benefits like cost savings, efficiency, etc.
4. **Detail Key Features**: Explain what's included in each service
5. **Choose Appropriate Images**: Use high-quality, relevant images
6. **Set Logical Order**: Arrange services in a logical flow
7. **Categorize Correctly**: Use "main" for primary services, "additional" for support services
